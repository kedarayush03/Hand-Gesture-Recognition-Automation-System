# Human-Machine Interaction Using Arduino-Based Robot Car and Hand Gesture Recognition

## Project Overview

This project aims to establish a seamless interaction between humans and machines by utilizing an Arduino-based robot car controlled through hand gesture recognition algorithms. The system is designed to aid individuals with physical disabilities, allowing them to operate electronic devices and appliances without physical touch. Additionally, it provides a hands-free solution for scenarios where direct interaction with devices is impractical or impossible.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For developing the hand gesture recognition algorithm.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and hand gesture detection.
- **TensorFlow**: For utilizing pre-trained models in gesture recognition.
- **MediaPipe**: For landmark detection in hand gestures.
- **Arduino UNO**: As the microcontroller for the robot car.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For development and testing of the algorithm.

## Key Features

- **Hand Gesture Control**: Operate an Arduino-based car using simple hand gestures.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverage existing frameworks to facilitate gesture recognition.
- **Human-Machine Interface**: Enhance life experiences for individuals with disabilities by bridging the gap between electronic devices and software interfaces.

## Motivation

Certain segments of society, such as physically handicapped individuals, face challenges in performing everyday tasks like driving a car or operating household appliances. This project seeks to improve their quality of life by providing a contactless interaction method. Additionally, hands-free control is beneficial in quarantine situations or scenarios where physical interaction with devices is undesirable.

## Aim

- To establish a connection between electronic devices and software, making life easier for individuals with disabilities.
- To operate a small motor car using a hand gesture recognition algorithm.

## Objectives

1. **Build a Small Motor Car**: Assemble and program a motor car using Arduino UNO.
2. **Integrate Gesture Recognition**: Combine the motor car with a Python-based hand gesture recognition code.
3. **Contactless Driving**: Enable the motor car to be driven using hand gestures only.

## How to Use

1. **Setup the Arduino Car**: Assemble the motor car and connect it to the Arduino UNO.
2. **Install Necessary Libraries**: Ensure that you have Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and MediaPipe installed in your development environment.
3. **Load the Hand Gesture Code**: Upload the provided Python code for hand gesture recognition.
4. **Connect Arduino**: Integrate the Arduino with the hand gesture recognition system.
5. **Operate the Car**: Use predefined hand gestures to control the movement of the car.

## Presentation and Publication
